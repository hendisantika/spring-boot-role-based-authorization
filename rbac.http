### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Test Cases

## This file contains HTTP requests to test the role-based access control functionality
## of the Spring Boot application. It demonstrates various authentication and authorization
## scenarios using different users and endpoints.

### 1. Authentication Tests

## 1.1 Basic Authentication with Admin User
GET http://localhost:8080/test
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=

### 1.2 Basic Authentication with Regular User
GET http://localhost:8080/noRoleNeeded
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp1c2VyMTIz

### 1.3 Form Login - Admin User
POST http://localhost:8080/login
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username = admin &
password = admin123

### 1.4 Form Login - Regular User
POST http://localhost:8080/login
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username = user &
password = user123

### 2. Authorization Tests - Admin User

## 2.1 Access endpoint requiring ADMIN role (should succeed)
GET http://localhost:8080/test
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=

## 2.2 Access endpoint requiring only authentication (should succeed)
GET http://localhost:8080/noRoleNeeded
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=

## 2.3 Access another endpoint requiring ADMIN role (should succeed)
GET http://localhost:8080/roleNeeded
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=

### 3. Authorization Tests - Regular User

## 3.1 Access endpoint requiring ADMIN role (should fail with 403 Forbidden)
GET http://localhost:8080/test
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp1c2VyMTIz

## 3.2 Access endpoint requiring only authentication (should succeed)
GET http://localhost:8080/noRoleNeeded
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp1c2VyMTIz

## 3.3 Access another endpoint requiring ADMIN role (should fail with 403 Forbidden)
GET http://localhost:8080/roleNeeded
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp1c2VyMTIz

### 4. Unauthorized Access Tests

## 4.1 Access protected endpoint without authentication (should fail with 401 Unauthorized)
GET http://localhost:8080/test

## 4.2 Access endpoint requiring only authentication without credentials (should fail with 401 Unauthorized)
GET http://localhost:8080/noRoleNeeded

## 4.3 Access endpoint requiring ADMIN role without authentication (should fail with 401 Unauthorized)
GET http://localhost:8080/roleNeeded

### 5. Invalid Credentials Tests

## 5.1 Attempt login with incorrect password (should fail)
POST http://localhost:8080/login
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username = admin &
password = wrongpassword

## 5.2 Attempt Basic Auth with incorrect credentials (should fail)
GET http://localhost:8080/test
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46d3JvbmdwYXNzd29yZA==

### 6. Additional Tests

## 6.1 H2 Console Access (should be accessible without authentication as configured in SecurityConfig)
GET http://localhost:8080/h2-console

## 6.2 Test with mixed-case username (to test case sensitivity)
GET http://localhost:8080/noRoleNeeded
Authorization: Basic QWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=
